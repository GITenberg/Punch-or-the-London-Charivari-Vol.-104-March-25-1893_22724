<h2>SMALL BY DEGREES.</h2>

<h3><i>A Story of Defiance not Defence.</i></h3>

<p>There was once a Battalion of Volunteers with
its full complement of field, company, and non-commissioned
officers, and rank and file. And
according to experts the Regiment was a most
valuable addition to the national defence. One
day a General, covered over with gold lace and
wearing a cocked hat, rode up to the Colonel and
called him out.</p>

<p>"Colonel," said the General, "we are thinking
of giving over your command to a C.O. of a D&eacute;p&ocirc;t
Centre. It won't interfere with you much and
give you less to do. You may still call yourself
Colonel&mdash;not that I call you so myself. I mean
off parade."</p>

<p>But the Colonel did not seem to see it, and so
he sent in his papers and rode away.</p>

<p>Then the General from the War Office called up
the two remaining Field Officers.</p>

<p>"Majors" said he, "it seems to us we can help
you a good deal by appointing a Major from a
service battalion as Adjutant. Then you can
rank beneath him, and he can look after you and
the two half battalions you each of you are supposed
to command. You may still call yourselves
Majors&mdash;not that I call you so myself. I mean off
parade."</p>

<p>But the Majors did not seem to
see it, so they sent in <i>their</i> papers
too.</p>

<p>Then the General from the War
Office called up the Company Officers.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said he, "we shall
continue the snubbing, of which you
have had so much experience. You
will do all sorts of new work, and
go to all sorts of fresh expense in the
near future. Not that it will increase
your dignity&mdash;not a bit of it.
However, you may still call yourselves
Captains and Lieutenants&mdash;not
that I call you so myself. I mean
off parade."</p>

<p>But the Company Officers did not
seem to see it, so they sent in their
papers and marched away. Then
the General from the War Office
called up the rest of the Regiment.</p>

<p>"Now, Non-commissioned Officers
and Men," said he, "you have no one
to command you, and no one to pay
for your marches out, prizes, and the
rest of it. But don't let that bother
you. You may still call yourselves
Soldiers&mdash;not that I call you
so myself. I mean off parade."</p>

<p>But the remainder of the Regiment
did not seem to see it, so they sent
in <i>their</i> resignations, and vanished.</p>

<p>Then the Officer from the War
Office rode towards Pall Mall.</p>

<p>"It won't interfere with me
much," said he, "and give the Department
less to do. And I can
still call myself General&mdash;though I
scarcely deserve the title, either on
or off parade!"</p>

<h2>THE WITLER'S WISION OF WENGEANCE.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="sc">In a slightly Pickwickian Sense</span>.)</h3>
<p><i>Being the Dream of an angry "Brother Bung" after attending the Meeting at St. James's Hall, and trying to soothe himself with a dip into
Dickens.</i></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/134.png"><img src="images/134-390.png" width="390" height="470" alt="Being the Dream of an angry 'Brother Bung'..." /></a>
</div><br /><br />



<p>["He" Lord <span class="sc">Burton</span>, "asked why this drastic, this dishonest, this
catchpenny, this gerrymandering Bill should have been brought in?....
They had heard much of late about the Nonconformist Conscience, which
was said to be the backbone of the Liberal Party. He firmly believed that
the Bill had been brought forward to suit the Nonconformist Conscience,
to pander to the hypocritical self-righteousness, and the sham respectability
of a certain class."&mdash;<i>Lord Burton, at the St. James's Hall Meeting, on the
Direct Veto Bill.</i>]</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, the elder, gave vent to an extraordinary sound,
which, being neither a groan, nor a grunt, nor a gasp, nor a howl,
nor a hoot, nor a hiss, nor a shout, nor a shriek, yet seemed to partake
in some degree of the character of all these inarticulate laryngeal
exercises. It was a big vocal blend, and a stentorian; it made him
pant and turn apoplectically purple in the face, it shook the house,
and very nearly "brought it down."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Witler's</span> "wocal wagaries" (as his son called them)
when he <i>was</i> roused, were something tremendous, earthquaky,
appalling!</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Swigslop Stiggins</span>, a leading Shepherd of the Nonconformist
Rechabite Flock, unwarned by this nondescript sound, which he
understood to betoken remorse or repentance, in fact, an awakening
of the "Nonconformist Conscience," in a somewhat unlikely quarter,
looked about him, rubbed his hands, wept, smiled, wept again, and
then mechanically uttering a guttural "Hear! Hear!" (as though
he were listening, in the House of Commons, to the jocund <span class="sc">Harcourt</span>,
or the jocular <span class="sc">Lawson</span>, or the robustious T. W. <span class="sc">Russell</span>, or the
astute <span class="sc">Caine</span>) and then, walking across the room to a well-remembered
pigeon-hole, took thence an official-looking scroll, sat down,
formally unfolded it, cleared his throat, and began with pompous
complacency to read aloud its title, preamble, clauses, and provisions,
compulsory regulations, and peremptory prohibitions to the
apparently semi-asphyxiated Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>.</p>

<p>The elder Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, who still continued to make various
strange and uncouth attempts to appear indifferent, offered not a
single word during these proceedings; but when <span class="sc">Stiggins</span> stopped
for breath, previous to a second reading, he darted upon him, and,
snatching the scroll from his hand, first buffeted him briskly about
the head therewith, and then threw it into the fire. Then, seizing
the astonished gentleman firmly by the collar, he suddenly fell to
kicking him most furiously, accompanying every application of his
boots to Mr. <span class="sc">Stiggins's</span> person with sundry violent and incoherent
anathemas, such as&mdash;"Blatant Barabbas!"&mdash;"Bumptious busybody!"&mdash;"Unblushing
bandit!"&mdash;"Barefaced spoliator!"&mdash;"Hypocritical
humbug!"&mdash;"Iniquitous inquisitor!"&mdash;"Fanatical
faddist!"&mdash;"Self-righteous sneak!"&mdash;"Sham
saint!"&mdash;"Jerrymandering <span class="sc">Jeremy Diddler</span>!"&mdash;"Pragmatical
pump!"&mdash;"Little Bethelite Boanerges!" and "Nonconformist
<i>Tartuffe</i>!!!"</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Sammy</span>," said Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, "put my cap on tight for me!"
<span class="sc">Sam</span> dutifully adjusted the cap more firmly on his father's head,
and the old gentleman, resuming his kicking with greater agility
than before, tumbled Mr. <span class="sc">Stiggins</span> through the bar, and through
the passage, out at the front door, and so into the street, the kicking
continuing the whole way, and increasing in vehemence rather than
diminishing every time the boot was lifted.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful and exhilarating sight (<i>to "the Trade"</i>) to see
the water-drinker writhing in Mr. <span class="sc">Witler's</span> grasp, and his whole
frame quivering with anguish as kick followed kick in rapid succession;
it was a still more exciting spectacle (<i>to Bungdom all round,
from boisterous</i> Lord <span class="sc">Burton</span> <i>to the humblest rural Boniface</i>)
to
behold Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, after a powerful struggle, immersing Mr.
<span class="sc">Stiggins's</span> head in a horse-trough full of water, and holding it there
until he was half suffocated.</p>

<p>"There!" said Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, throwing all his energy into one
most complicated kick, as he at length permitted Mr. <span class="sc">Stiggins</span>
to withdraw his head from the trough, "send any vun o' them
villainous Vetoists, from burly Sir <span class="sc">Villiam Barabbas</span> hisself
down to the pettifoggingest Local Hoptioniser in Little Peddlington,
<i>here</i>, or to St. James's 'All, or the Alhambra, or elseveres
in public meeting or privit pub, and I'll pound him to a argymentative
jelly fust, and drownd him in public-speritted opinion
arterwards!"</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Sammy</span>" (added Mr. <span class="sc">Witler</span>, puffing and perspiring freely),
"help me in, and fill me a stiff glass o' Speshal Scotch; for I'm out
of breath, my boy!"</p>

<p><i>Mistress</i> (<i>to Housekeeper, after "the Young Person" has left the

Person. She is too Ugly by far!</span>"</p>

<p><i>Housekeeper.</i> "<span class="sc">Very sorry, Mum. But you said <i>so particularly</i>

<p><span class="sc">Very Natural.</span>&mdash;Mrs. R. pays great attention to the Parliamentary
debates, and listens attentively while her Nephew reads the speeches
as reported in <i>The Times</i>. Last Thursday he was in the midst of the
discussion on the Welsh Liquor-Traffic Bill, and came to this:
"Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd-George</span>, whose opening remarks were interrupted by a
Count&mdash;&mdash;" Whereupon his Aunt exclaimed, "How very rude!
What was the Count's name? And how does a Count come to be in
the House of Commons?"</p>

<h2>PILL-DOCTOR HERDAL.</h2>

<h4>(<i>Translated from the Original Norwegian by Mr. Punch.</i>)</h4>

<h3>THIRD ACT.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
<i>On the right, a smart verandah, attached to</i> Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal's</span> <i>dwelling-house,
and communicating with the Drawing-room and Dispensary
by glass-doors. On the left a tumble-down rockery, with
a headless plaster Mercury. In front, a lawn, with a large
silvered glass globe on a stand. Chairs and tables. All the
furniture is of galvanised iron. A sunset is seen going on
among the trees.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Dr. Herdal</i> (<i>comes out of Dispensary-door cautiously, and
whispers</i>). <span class="sc">Hilda</span>, are you in there?</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Taps with fingers on Drawing-room door.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>comes out with a half-teasing smile</i>). Well&mdash;and how is
the Rainbow-powder getting on, Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i>
(<i>with enthusiasm</i>).
It is getting
on simply
splendidly. I
sent the new
Assistant out to
take a little
walk, so that he
should not be in
the way. There
is Arsenic in the
powder, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>,
and Digitalis
too, and Strychnine,
and the best Beetle-killer!</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>with happy, wondering eyes</i>). <i>Lots</i> of
Beetle-killer? And you will give some of it
to <i>her</i>, to make her free and buoyant. I
think one really <i>has</i> the right&mdash;when people
happen to stand in the way&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Yes, you may well say so, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>.
Still&mdash;(<i>dubiously</i>)&mdash;it <i>does</i> occur to me that
such doings may perhaps be misunderstood&mdash;by
the narrow-minded and conventional.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>They go on the lawn, and sit down.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>with an outburst</i>). Oh, that all seems
to me so foolish&mdash;so irrelevant! As if the
whole thing wasn't intended as an Allegory!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>relieved</i>). Ah, so long as it is
merely <i>allegorical</i> of course&mdash;&mdash; But what is
it an allegory <i>of</i>, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>?</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>reflects in vain</i>). How can you sit
there and ask such questions? I suppose I am
a symbol, of some sort.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>as a thought flashes upon him</i>).
A cymbal? That would certainly account for
your bra&mdash;&mdash; Then am <i>I</i> a cymbal too, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>?</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Why yes&mdash;what else? You represent
the Artist-worker, or the Elder Generation,
or the Pursuit of the Ideal, or a Bilious
Conscience&mdash;or something or other. <i>You</i>'re
all right!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>shakes his head</i>). Am I? But I
don't quite see&mdash;&mdash; Well, well, cymbals are
meant to clash a little. And I see plainly now
that I ought to prescribe this powder for as
many as possible. Isn't it terrible, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>,
that so many poor souls never really die their
own deaths&mdash;pass out of the world without
even the formality of an inquest? As the
district Coroner, I feel strongly on the subject.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> And, when the Coroner has finished
sitting on all the bodies, perhaps&mdash;but I shan't
tell you now. (<i>Speaks as if to a child.</i>) There, run away and finish
making the Rainbow-powder, do!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>skips up into the Dispensary</i>). I will&mdash;I will! Oh,
I do feel such a troll&mdash;such a light-haired, light-headed old devil!</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub</i> (<i>enters garden-gate</i>). I have had my dismissal&mdash;but I'm
not going without saying good-bye to Mrs. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span> would disapprove&mdash;you really must not, Mr.
<span class="sc">Kalomel</span>. And, besides, Mrs. <span class="sc">Herdal</span> is not at home. She is in
the town buying me a reel of cotton. <i>Dr.</i> <span class="sc">Herdal</span> is in. He is
making real Rainbow powders for regenerating everybody all round.
Won't <i>that</i> be fun?</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub.</i> <i>Making</i> powders? Ha! ha! But you will see he won't
<i>take</i> one himself. It is quite notorious to us younger men that he
simply daren't do it.</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> (<i>with a little snort of contempt</i>). Oh, I daresay&mdash;that's so
likely! (<i>Defiantly.</i>) I know he <i>can</i>, though. I've <i>seen</i>
him!</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub.</i> There is a tradition that he once&mdash;but not now&mdash;he knows
better. I think you said Mrs. <span class="sc">Herdal</span> was in the town? I will go
and look for her. I understand her so well. [<i>Goes out by gate.</i></p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>calls</i>). Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>! Come out this minute. I want
you&mdash;awfully!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>puts his head out</i>). Just when I am making such
wonderful progress with the powder! (<i>Comes down and leans on a
table.</i>) Have you hit upon some way of giving it to <span class="sc">Aline</span>? I
thought if you were to put it in her arrowroot&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> No, thanks. I won't have that now. I have just
recollected that it is a rule of mine never to injure anybody I have
once been formally introduced to. Strangers don't count. No, poor
Mrs. <span class="sc">Herdal</span> mustn't take that powder!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>disappointed</i>). Then is nothing to come of making
Rainbow powders, after all, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>?</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>looks hard at him</i>). People
say you are afraid to take your own
physic. Is that true?</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Yes, I am. (<i>After a
pause&mdash;with candour.</i>) I find it invariably
disagrees with me.</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>with a half-dubious smile</i>).
I think I can understand <i>that</i>. But
you did <i>once</i>. You swallowed your
own pills that day at the <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i>,
ten years ago. And I heard a harp
in the air, too!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>open-mouthed</i>). I don't
think that <i>could</i> have been Me. I
don't play any instrument. And
that was quite a special thing, too.
It's not every day I can do it. Those
were only <i>bread</i> pills, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>.</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>with flashing eyes</i>). But
you rolled them; you took them.
And I want to see you stand once
more free and high and great, swallowing
your own preparations.
(<i>Passionately.</i>) I <i>will</i> have you do
it! (<i>Imploringly.</i>) Just <i>once</i> more,
Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>!</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> If I did, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>, my
medical knowledge, slight as it is,
leads me to the conclusion that I
should in all probability burst.</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>looks deeply into his eyes</i>).
So long as you burst <i>beautifully</i>!
But no doubt that Miss <span class="sc">Blakdraf</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> You must believe in
me utterly and entirely. I will do
anything&mdash;<i>anything</i>, <span class="sc">Hilda</span>, to provide
you with agreeable entertainment.
I <i>will</i> swallow my own
powder! (<i>To himself, as he goes
gravely up to Dispensary.</i>) If only
the drugs are sufficiently adulterated!</p>

[<i>Goes in; as he does so, the</i> New

</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Senna Blakdraf</i> (<i>comes wildly out
of Drawing-room</i>). Where is dear
Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span>? Oh, Miss <span class="sc">Wangel</span>,
he has discharged me&mdash;but I can't&mdash;I
simply <i>can't</i> live away from that
lovely ledger!</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>jubilantly</i>). At this moment Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal</span> is in the
Dispensary,
taking one of his own powders.</p>

<p><i>Senna</i> (<i>despairingly</i>). But&mdash;but it is utterly impossible! Miss
<span class="sc">Wangel</span>, you have such a firm hold of him&mdash;<i>don't</i> let him do
that!</p>

<p><i>Hilda.</i> I have already done all I can.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<span class="sc">R&uuml;bub</span> <i>appears, talking confidentially with Mrs.</i> <span class="sc">Herdal</span>, <i>at

<p><i>Senna.</i> Oh, Mrs. <span class="sc">Herdal, R&uuml;bub</span>! The Pill-Doctor is going to
take one of his own preparations. Save him&mdash;quick!</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub</i> (<i>with cold politeness</i>). I am sorry to hear it&mdash;for his
sake. But it would be quite contrary to professional etiquette to
prevent him.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> And I never interfere with my husband's proceedings.
I know <i>my</i> duty, Miss <span class="sc">Blakdraf</span>, if <i>others</i> don't!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>exulting with great intensity</i>). At last! Now I see him
in there, great and free again, mixing the powder in a spoon&mdash;with
jam!.... Now he raises the spoon. Higher&mdash;higher still!
(<i>A gulp is audible from within.</i>) There, didn't you hear a harp
in the air? (<i>Quietly.</i>) I can't see the spoon any more. But
there is one he is striving with, in blue spectacles!</p>

<p><i>The New Assistant's Voice</i> (<i>within</i>). The Pill-Doctor

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>as if petrified</i>). That voice! <i>Where</i> have I heard it
before? No matter&mdash;he has got the powder down! (<i>Waves a

thrilling! My&mdash;<i>my</i> Pill-Doctor!</p>

<p><i>The N. A.</i> (<i>comes out on verandah</i>). I am happy to inform you
that&mdash;as, to avoid accidents, I took the simple precaution of filling
all the Dispensary-jars with Camphorated Chalk&mdash;no serious results
may be anticipated from Dr. <span class="sc">Herdal's</span> rashness. (<i>Removes
spectacles.</i>)
<span class="sc">Nora</span>, don't you know me?</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>reflects</i>). I really don't remember having the
pleasure&mdash;&mdash;And
I'm <i>sure</i> I heard a harp in the air!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Herd.</i> I fancy, Miss <span class="sc">Wangel</span>, it must have been merely
a bee in your bonnet!</p>

<p><i>The N. A.</i> (<i>tenderly</i>). Still the same little singing-bird! Oh,
<span class="sc">Nora</span>, my long-lost lark!</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>sulky</i>). I'm <i>not</i> a lark&mdash;I'm a Bird of Prey&mdash;and,
when
I get my claws into anything&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>The N. A.</i> Macaroons, for instance? I remember your tastes of
old. See, <span class="sc">Nora</span>! (<i>Produces a paper-bag from his coat-tail
pocket.</i>)
They were fresh this morning!</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>wavering</i>). If you insist on calling me <span class="sc">Nora</span>, I
think you
must be just a little mad yourself.</p>

<p><i>The N. A.</i> We are all a little mad&mdash;in Norway. But <span class="sc">Torvald
Helmer</span> is sane enough still to recognise his own little squirrel
again! Surely, <span class="sc">Nora</span>, your education is complete at last&mdash;you have
gained the experience you needed?</p>

<p><i>Hilda</i> (<i>nods slowly</i>). Yes, <span class="sc">Torvald</span>, you're right enough
<i>there</i>.
I have thought things out for myself, and have got clear about
them. And I have quite made up my mind that Society and the
Law are all wrong, and that I am right.</p>

<p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>overjoyed</i>). Then you <i>have</i> learnt the Great Lesson,
and are
fit to undertake the charge of your children's education at last!
You've no notion how they've grown! Yes, <span class="sc">Nora</span>, our marriage
will be a true marriage now. You will come back to the Doll's-House,
won't you?</p>

<p><i>Hilda-Nora-Helmer-Wangel</i> (<i>hesitates</i>). Will you let me forge
cheques if I do, <span class="sc">Torvald</span>?</p>

<p><i>Helmer</i> (<i>ardently</i>). All day. And at night, <span class="sc">Nora</span>, we will
falsify the accounts&mdash;together!</p>

<p><i>H. N. H. W.</i> (<i>throws herself into his arms, and helps herself

<p><i>Helmer.</i> Not in the least. But this lady is my little lark, and she
is going back to her cage by the next steamer.</p>

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> (<i>bitterly</i>). Am I <i>never</i> to have a gleam of

But stay&mdash;do I see my little <span class="sc">Senna</span> once more?</p>

<p><i>R&uuml;bub.</i> Pardon me&mdash;<i>my</i> little <span class="sc">Senna</span>. She always believed so

<p><i>Dr. Herd.</i> Well&mdash;well. If it must be. <span class="sc">R&uuml;bub</span>, I will take you
into partnership, and we will take out a patent for that pill, jointly.
<span class="sc">Aline</span>, my poor dear <span class="sc">Aline</span>, let us try once more if we cannot

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><i><span class="sc">Burdett's</span> Official Intelligence for</i> 1893 is just out, a
promising
young thing in its twelfth year. It is a little early to talk of the
holidays, but my Baronite, regarding this thin Vol. of 1783 pages,
says he cannot help thinking with what pleasure the City merchant,
or his clerk, hastening to the seaside, will pack it up with his
collar-box. Every year the monumental work increases in value,
by reason of accumulated information. To the tired City man, scaling
some Alp, gliding in well-found yacht over silver seas, or prone in
bosky dell, there can be nothing more soothing or delightful than to
take his "<span class="sc">Burdett</span>" out of his waistcoat-pocket, and read it through
from first page to last.</p>

<p>For <i>The Tragedy of Ida Noble</i> the Baron tenders his grateful
thanks to <span class="sc">W. Clark Russell</span>. It starts well, and the excitement is
artistically sustained. At the close of every chapter <i>Oliver</i>, the
reader, is perpetually "asking for more." A capital story of
adventure, where all, including the reader, are "quite at sea" until
the very last chapter. On nearing the middle of the book, the
question will occur to everyone experienced in such matters, "Does
the hero marry the heroine?" Now this, being a lady's secret,
will not be revealed by <span class="sc">The Baron de B.-W.</span></p>

following Advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<p>TO IRISH LOYALISTS AND PROTESTANTS.&mdash;<span class="sc">Death before
Slavery!</span></p>

<p>Surely a most blameless sentiment. But the bearings of it lie in
the application. And what is that? It seems as applicable to any
existing situation as, say, "Lunch before Dinner," or "Business
before Pleasure," or "Age before Honesty," or "Fingers before
forks." <i>Mr. Punch</i> ventures to suggest a modification, less striking,
perhaps, in an "Agony-Column," but more in accord with
patriotism and common-sense:&mdash;</p>

<p>The flamboyant, melodramatic, "Death before Slavery!" <i>may</i> be
applicable&mdash;when "Slavery" becomes a conceivable, proximate
probability, or "Death" a possible alternative. Then let us have
"Death before Slavery," by all means. At present, <i>Punch</i> would
say, "Common-sense before either!"</p>

<h3>No. VIII.&mdash;THE BOAT-RACE.</h3>


<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Are any of you chaps going to the Boat-Race?</p>

<p><i>First Well-Informed Man.</i> No, I shan't. Everybody knows
which is going to win, so there's deuced little interest in the race;
and then you can always read it on the tape at your Club. Besides,
I don't care much about rowing. It's a silly sort of exercise; anybody
can do it.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Have you ever tried?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). Have I ever tried? Of course I
have. Why, you were with
me last Summer when we
had that water-party from
Taplow to Cookham.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/141.png"><img src="images/141-300.png" width="300" height="216" alt="The Boat-Race" /></a>
</div>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Ah!
but you didn't do much
rowing then. You let me
get all the blisters, and you
just sat in the stern and
steered us like a blessed
corkscrew.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Did I?
I didn't remember that;
but I do remember you
catching about half-a-dozen crabs one after another.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> True enough I caught one, but that was because
you would keep standing up in the boat, and moving your body
backwards and forwards. I suppose you thought the coxswains do
that in their racing-boats?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>boldly</i>). They do. I've seen 'em doing it often.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Why, I thought you'd never seen the crews at all.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Bosh! I never said anything of the kind. I'm
not going to see the race this year, but I've often seen 'em practising
down at Putney. Everybody knows the coxswains have to stand up.
How do you suppose they could see to steer if they didn't? So
where are you now, with all your accurate information, eh?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> I'm where I was before, and I know I'm right,
because my brother-in-law had a cousin who was at school with one
of the Coxes about ten years ago. [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>looking up from his sporting paper</i>). I say, I thought
the crews rowed in racing-boats.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> So they do.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Well, then, what does this mean? (<i>Reads.</i>) "Both
yesterday and to-day Cambridge rowed with a bucket. They must
improve this if they want to win."</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>smiling</i>). My dear fellow, they call their big
practising-boat a bucket.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> No, they don't&mdash;they call it a tub.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, tub or bucket, it's the same thing. (<i>To</i>
Inquirer.) What you read just now means that their practising-boat
has gone rotten, and they'll have to mend her up a bit.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). But they don't row the race in a tub or a
bucket, do they?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> No, they row in a Clinker-Clasper.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> What the deuce is that?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>plunging</i>). Oh, it's a specially fast kind of
racing-boat, built by <span class="sc">Clinker and Clasper</span>. They're a firm of
boat-builders&mdash;I thought everybody knew that.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But then, what does this paper mean by saying that
Oxford are rowing in a Rough?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Why it means that their boat isn't so smooth as
that of Cambridge.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>puzzled</i>). But then it goes on to say that "She is as
fine a specimen of a racing-craft as this eminent boat-builder has
ever turned out." How can she be that, if she isn't as smooth as the
Cambridge boat? Besides, who's "this eminent boat-builder?"</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> <span class="sc">Rough</span>.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Rot!</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> <span class="sc">Rough</span>, not Rot. <span class="sc">Rough's</span> his name.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Let me see the paper. (<i>He reads, and
addresses the</i> Inquirer.) Why didn't you say the word was printed
with a capital R? (<i>To</i> Average Man.) Perhaps you're right, after
all; but I know some boats <i>are</i> rougher than others. [<i>A pause.</i></p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> What's the difference between First Trinity and Third
Trinity? Three of the Cambridge men are from First Trinity, and
two from Third Trinity, besides the Cox.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> What's your difficulty? First is first, and
Third's third, all the world over. Don't you see, the First Trinity
men come first in the crew, and then the Third Trinity men.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But why don't some of 'em call themselves Second
Trinity men?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, that's one of their silly bits of College
etiquette. These chaps at the Universities are never happy unless
they do things quite differently from all the rest of the world.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> This beastly paper says, "the Cambridge stroke rowed
much longer to-day."</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, what then?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Oh! nothing; only I thought they all rowed exactly
the same distance when they're practising; so I don't quite see how
any of 'em could have rowed longer than the rest.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> I daresay they made him row a good bit by himself;
they often do that to give the stroke some extra practice. He
wants it more than any of the rest.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Why?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, ah&mdash;well, because he's got to set the stroke
for the others, or something of that sort.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> How far do they row in the race?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> About six miles or so.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> By Jove, then, how on earth do they manage to get
over all that distance with so few strokes. (<i>Refers to paper.</i>) It
says, "Oxford rowed 37 all the way, while Cambridge contented
themselves with a well-pulled 35." (<i>With a happy inspiration.</i>) If
Cambridge can do it in 35 strokes, while Oxford take 37, it looks
jolly like Cambridge winning by two strokes, don't it?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> All right; I'll lay you the odds on Oxford.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Good, I'll take 'em to five pounds. Oxford
can't win.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>confidently</i>). Cambridge can't win. Anyway,
I'll lay you ten pounds to five.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> I should like to have a bet with somebody.</p>

<p><i>Average Man.</i> You'd better write to one of the Presidents of
the University-Boat Clubs. They're always ready to oblige a keen
fellow like you with a bet.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Of course. That's my best plan. I'll write to-day.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[In a recent trial, Mr. Justice <span class="sc">Hawkins</span> corrected a learned Counsel who
talked about Witnesses "coming up to the scratch."]
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>taking his seat</i>). I think, Mr. <span class="sc">Smallfee</span>, that
you
were examining a Witness when we adjourned yesterday. Are you
ready to go on with the examination?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smallfee</i> (<i>pleasantly</i>). I am sorry to say that Witness has not
turned up yet, m'Lud!</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>pained</i>). Not <i>what</i>?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smallfee.</i> I beg your Lordship's pardon. Of course what I
<i>meant</i> was that the Witness has not, as yet, condescended to irradiate
the precincts of this tribunal with the sunshine of his presence.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> <i>That's</i> better! Then we must go on to the next
Witness.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smallfee</i> (<i>with an evident attempt to keep up his spirits, in
spite of misfortune</i>). The next Witness, also, I regret to say, has not
turned&mdash;&mdash;I mean, has failed to appear. The Solicitor informs
me that he solemnly promised to attend; but I suppose the promise
was all my eye.</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Dear, dear! What extraordinary expressions you do
use, Mr. <span class="sc">Smallfee</span>! All my eye! Perhaps you will kindly interpret
the phrase, for the benefit of the Court.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smallfee</i> (<i>desperately</i>). As your Lordship pleases! But, as
I feel rather down in the mouth now, and as the twelve sufferers
in the Jury-box evidently think that this trial has lasted long
enough already, and that we ought to stir our stumps, I would
suggest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Judge.</i> Usher! Step across to Booksellers' Row, and buy me a
Slang Dictionary! I cannot&mdash;I really <i>cannot</i> follow the learned
Counsel.</p>

<p><i>The Foreman</i> (<i>interposing</i>). <i>We</i> do not object to colloquial
expressions,
my Lord. Y' see, we're a <i>Common</i> Jury, and we rather like
them. All we want to do is to get on with the case. And perhaps
it may assist the Court if at this stage I remark that the Jury has
quite made up its mind, and is ready to give its verdict.</p>

<p><i>The Judge</i> (<i>astounded</i>). But&mdash;but&mdash;there has been no evidence
for the defence!</p>

<p><i>The Foreman</i> (<i>calmly</i>). No, my Lord. But no doubt the learned
Counsel's two Witnesses, had they been present, would have
supplied some; and, anyhow, we are so pleased with his talking down
to our level, and not&mdash;as usual&mdash;over our heads, that we are all
agreed to find a verdict for his client, the Defendant.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Smallfee</i> (<i>bowing</i>). Thanks for your good opinion, Gentlemen.
I thought, by the cut of your jibs, you were the right sort.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Winks, in passing out.</i>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h3><span class="sc">Extracted From the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span></h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night,
March 13.</i>&mdash;No use disguising fact that when
House discovered <span class="sc">Frederick Milner</span> standing
behind Front Opposition Bench, brandishing
heavy boot in his hand as he addressed
<span class="sc">Asquith</span>, it held its breath. Political passion
runs pretty high of late; Opposition stirred
to deepest depths by persistence of Government
in attempting to read Home-Rule Bill
Second Time before Easter. There have
been sittings after midnight; sittings through
Saturday; hot words bandied about; preparation
for deadly duel in lobby. No one
can say whither men may be led when once
they permit angry passions to rise. <span class="sc">Charles
Russell</span>, whose acquaintance with criminal
classes is extensive, tells me it is by no means
uncommon thing for prisoner in dock to take
off boot and hurl it at head of presiding
Magistrate or Judge.</p>

<p>"Usually an old woman who does it," he
added.</p>

<p>"But this is Sir <span class="sc">Frederick Milner</span>,
Bart.," I said.</p>

<p>"Um!" said <span class="sc">Russell</span>, with odd significance
in the observation.</p>

<p>Turns out the apprehension groundless.
<span class="sc">Milner</span> only wants to know why Police at
Leeds and Bradford should enjoy ultimate resources
of civilisation in respect of "<span class="sc">Scaith's</span>
silent boots," whilst London Policemen not so
privileged? <span class="sc">Milner</span> tells me his earliest idea
was to get a pair of the boots, put 'em on, and
surprise <span class="sc">Speaker</span> by approaching with noiseless
tread from behind Chair, lean over his
shoulder, and suddenly say, "Boo!" That,
<span class="sc">Milner</span> thought, would be conclusive proof
of the efficacy of the boots as making the
tread inaudible. On other hand, <span class="sc">Speaker</span>
mightn't like it. So, by way of compromise,
brought down odd boot in tail-pocket of his
coat, and shook it at <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span> when
he put question.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Asquith</span> behaved very well under trying
circumstances. Did not visibly blench;
answered, in off-hand manner, that London
Police had had opportunity of substituting
the silent boot for those in ordinary use, and
had not availed themselves of it. Some had
objected on domestic grounds. Female friends
engaged in responsible posts in certain households
on their beat were accustomed to the
sound of their footfall on the pavement, and
would not have things ready if they approached
like rose-leaves flitting over shaven
lawns. Others, assuming higher ground,
resented silent boot as taking unfair advantage
of the burglar or footpad. "Give a 'ardworking
cove a fair chanst, that's my motter,"
one honest fellow in blue said to <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span>
when Right Hon. Gentleman brought
silent boot under his notice. No use attempting
to run counter to feeling of this kind.
Conclusion in which <span class="sc">Dicky Temple</span> heartily
concurred.</p>

<p>"Silent boot," he said, "forced upon Metropolitan
Police might play in history a part
analogous to that of the greased cartridges
on which we slipped into the Indian Mutiny."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Milner</span> saw it was evidently no use, so returning
boot to coat-tail pocket, moodily
regarded Treasury Bench.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/143.png"><img src="images/143-600.png" width="600" height="436" alt="'WANTING TO KNOW;' OR, THE BEWILDERED USHER." /></a>
<h3>"WANTING TO KNOW;" OR, THE BEWILDERED USHER.</h3></div>

<p>But there were consolations. <span class="sc">Squire</span> of
<span class="sc">Malwood</span>, asked by Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> what he
now thought of prospects of reading Home-Rule
Bill Second Time before Easter, admitted
impossibility; triumphant shout from Opposition.
Not in vain had they sat through
morning sitting on Friday discussing the
hour at which they should adjourn on Saturday.
Not without recompense had they
taken care that when Saturday came it should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span>
see accomplished the minimum of business. Tussling with Mr. G.
ever since Session opened; in first rounds he came off best; drew
first blood; seemed likely to carry everything with him; Opposition
pulled themselves together; went at it hammer and tongs; and
now it is Mr. G. who has retired to corner; the sponge is in
requisition on the Treasury Bench; the air around it redolent of
the perfume of the indispensable vinegar.</p>

<p>"Guinness will go up a point or two on this," said <span class="sc">Ellis Ashmead
Bartlett</span>, Knight, who has taken Irish securities under his wing.
"Go down a pint or two, you mean," said <span class="sc">Wilfrid Lawson</span>, who is
irreclaimable.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Attack on Justice <span class="sc">Mathew</span> and Evicted Tenants'
Commission repulsed by 287 Votes against 250.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Squire</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span> a changed man. No longer
the
light-hearted, sometimes almost frivolous youth who through six
years sat on Front Opposition Bench, and girded at the Unionist
Government. A Minister himself now; Mr. G.'s right-hand man;
First Lieutenant of the Ship of State; acting Captain when,
as happens just now, Mr. G. temporarily turned in. Once this afternoon
something of old spirit stirred within him when <span class="sc">Howard
Vincent</span> (as he said) used the Stationary Vote as a peg on which to
hang Protection heresies. But, for most part, he sits silent and self-communing,
saying nothing, but, probably, like the parrot of old,
thinking the more. In Conservative ranks feeling of profound
respect growing in his favour. Curious to hear them say, "Ah! if
everyone on Treasury Bench bore himself like <span class="sc">Harcourt</span>, things
would be different." Even the blameless <span class="sc">Bryce</span> is held up to
contumely in contrast with mild-mannered <span class="sc">Master</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span>. As
for <span class="sc">Charles Russell</span>, after his speech last night, good Conservatives,
following an Eastern custom, well enough in its place, spit when
they mention his name. For them the model of all Parliamentary
virtue is the <span class="sc">Squire</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span>.</p>

<p>Don't know how long this passion of appreciation will last; interesting
to observe while yet with us. A lull all round in sympathy
with soothing moments of <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> of <span class="sc">Exchequer</span>. Even J. W.
<span class="sc">Lowther's</span> perturbed mind at rest. Knows now, to a fraction, how
many lead-pencils are annually in use in directing destinies of
British Empire. Rumour current that origin of this inquiry was a
little undertaking promoted by Hon. Member in substitution of proscribed
word-guessing competitions. Sweep got up; &pound;5 entry; every
man to guess at precise figure of lead-pencil census; the one coming
nearest to clear the pool. <span class="sc">Lowther</span> tells me not word of truth in
report. In putting his question as to number of lead-pencils in use,
and in sticking to it in spite of jeers of bystanders and guilty
reticence of Minister, he was actuated simply by motives of public
policy; desired, in short, to live up to standard of late lamented
Leader and do his duty to his <span class="sc">Queen</span> and Country.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Great lead-pencil question settled. Excited
House Counted Out at 9.20.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/144a.png"><img src="images/144a-500.png" width="500" height="307" alt="'Back!! Rasch intruder!'" /></a>
<h3>"Back!! Rasch intruder!"</h3></div>

<p><i>Thursday Night.</i>&mdash;House
dying to know what Major
<span class="sc">Frederick Carne Rasch</span>
had to say on Navy Estimates.
Not being Major of
Marines, initial difficulty is
to imagine what he did in
this galley. If it had been the Army, or even the Militia, the
Major would have seemed all right. But what had he to do with
the Navy? That, however, is for the Major a minor point. "You
<span class="sc">Carne</span> be too <span class="sc">Rasch</span> when attacking this Government," said
<span class="sc">Kenyon</span>,
with his pretty elliptical speech.</p>

<p>It was half-past ten, and a dull night. Navy Estimates been
talked round for nearly five hours. <span class="sc">Squire</span> of <span class="sc">Malwood</span> meekly
hoped that a Vote would now be taken; <span class="sc">Dicky Temple</span> presented
himself at footlights with bewitching smile on his lips and elegantly
bound gilt-edged volume under his arm; bowed to audience;
opened volume; proceeding to offer few remarks when <span class="sc">Squire</span>
swooped down on him with Closure.</p>

<p>This was cue for <span class="sc">Rasch</span>. Chairman rose to put question. So did
<span class="sc">Rasch</span>. Closure must not be debated; attempt to speak is unpardonable
breach of order. The Major stood in the imminent
deadly breach; House howled; Chairman cried, "Order! Order!"
<span class="sc">Rasch</span> glared round, and, after moment's hesitation, sat down; up
again as soon as Question was put; howls more anguished than
ever. Committee having agreed that Question be put, nothing to
do but put it, and here was <span class="sc">Rasch</span> bubbling over with speech.
Chairman on his feet peremptorily signalling Major to sit down;
Members near him tugged at his coat-tails; those further off
frantically wave deprecatory hands. Major stood to his guns;
shouts of "Name! Name!" Chairman, desperately pegging
away, succeeded in putting Question, being money-vote for Navy.
Major by this time hauled down in his seat. Up again, like Jack
out of box. Chairman also on his feet, putting next vote; hubbub
tremendous; Major's lips observed in motion; not an articulate
syllable rose above uproar.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/144b.png"><img src="images/144b-350.png" width="350" height="300" alt="On the Stroke of Twelve; or, Cinderella Balfour!" /></a>
<h3>On the Stroke of Twelve; or, Cinderella Balfour!</h3></div>

<p>Meanwhile Chairman had dexterously put and run through
supplementary vote for Excess of Expenditure;
friends near him had got the catapultic Major
down again, in time to hear Chairman declare
"the Ayes have it!" Major up again. "Order!
order!" shouted the Chairman. "Question:
is&mdash;&mdash;" Not quite clear amid uproar what question
was; something to do with Army. Anyhow,
there was <span class="sc">Stanhope</span> standing at table
discussing Army Votes. Major again on his feet,
his moustache twitching with astonishment.
<span class="sc">Stanhope</span> a peculiarly painful circumstance; all
very well for good Conservative to gird against
Government, and jostle Mr. G.'s Chairman of
Committees; different (especially for a Major in
the Militia) to struggle with Statesman who
had been Secretary of State for War on his own
side. So Major, defiantly glaring round House slowly dropped into
his seat:&mdash;"dying with all his music in him," as <span class="sc">Justin McCarthy</span>,
who knows the poets, said. But what was the tune he meditated?
What is the secret of this unspoken speech?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
